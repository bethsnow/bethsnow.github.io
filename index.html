<h3><b>ABOUT ME:</b></h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Beth Snow and I am a senior Spanish major (with an unofficial French minor) at Bob Jones University. Being a Spanish major, I am part of the University Language Association, which exists to help modern language students grow in language proficiency. You can learn more about ULA here:<a href="https://www.facebook.com/bju.ula/"><b>BJU Language Association</b>.</a></p>
<p>As you can tell from my area of study, I am extremely interetsed in languages. However I have many different interests. Just to keep things simple, I'll only mention a few: I love outdoor activities, such as runnung or hiking; I treasure moments with my friends and family; and I'm an avid reader. Books have contributed so much to my life, and I try to challenge myself each year to read a certain number of books, using Goodreads to record my progress.
